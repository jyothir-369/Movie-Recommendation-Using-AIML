# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML

A content-based movie recommender system built with **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**. It suggests movies similar to a selected one based on genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview — ideal for learners exploring **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **recommendation engines**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning** and **NLP techniques** can be applied to build a practical movie recommendation engine. It uses movie metadata and applies **content-based filtering** to generate relevant and explainable suggestions.

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Content-Based Filtering using movie metadata  
- 🎭 Based on **genres**, **cast**, **crew**, **keywords**, and **overview**  
- 🧠 Transparent model — no black-box deep learning  
- ⚡ Fast, explainable results using **Cosine Similarity**  
- 🧮 Vectorization via **CountVectorizer**

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Merge `movies.csv` and `credits.csv` using the movie ID.  
2. Extract key features: **genres**, **keywords**, **cast**, **crew**, **overview**.  
3. Combine all features into a single `tags` column.  
4. Vectorize the tags using `CountVectorizer`.  
5. Compute cosine similarity between vectors.  
6. Recommend top 5 similar movies based on the input.

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `ast`  
- `nltk` *(optional, for advanced preprocessing)*

## 💻 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jyothir-369/Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML
2️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
3️⃣ Run the Notebook
Open movie-recommendation-system.ipynb and run all cells to view movie recommendations.

🔧 Potential Improvements
🌐 Deploy as a Flask or Streamlit web app

🧠 Use TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT for better embeddings

🎞️ Display movie posters alongside recommendations

🔁 Add hybrid filtering (content + collaborative)

📡 Integrate with TMDB/IMDb APIs for real-time movie data
