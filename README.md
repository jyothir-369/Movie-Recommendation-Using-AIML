🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML
A content-based movie recommender system built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. It suggests movies similar to a selected one based on genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview — a great project for learners exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) and recommendation engines.

🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning and NLP techniques can be applied to build a practical movie recommendation engine. It leverages movie metadata and applies content-based filtering to generate relevant and explainable suggestions.

🎯 Features
✅ Content-Based Filtering using movie metadata

🎭 Based on genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview

🧠 Transparent model — no black-box deep learning

⚡ Fast, explainable results using Cosine Similarity

🧮 Vectorization via CountVectorizer

⚙️ How It Works
Merge movies.csv and credits.csv using the movie ID.

Extract key features: genres, keywords, cast, crew, overview.

Combine all features into a single tags column.

Vectorize the tags using CountVectorizer.

Calculate cosine similarity between vectors.

Recommend top 5 similar movies based on the input movie.

📦 Libraries Used

💻 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/jyothir-369/Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML
2️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook

🔧 Potential Improvements
🌐 Deploy as a Flask or Streamlit web app

🧠 Use TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT for better embeddings

🎞️ Display movie posters alongside recommendations

🔁 Add hybrid filtering (content + collaborative)

📡 Integrate with TMDB/IMDb APIs for real-time movie data
