🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML
A simple and effective content-based movie recommender system built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. It suggests movies similar to the one you like based on genre, cast, keywords, and more.

🚀 Overview
This project showcases how machine learning and natural language processing can be applied to build an intelligent movie recommendation engine. It is ideal for those learning AI/ML concepts and looking for a hands-on application with real-world datasets.

🎯 Features
🔍 Content-based filtering

🎭 Recommends movies based on genre, overview, cast, crew, and keywords

🧠 Cosine similarity for computing movie similarity

📊 Data preprocessing and vectorization using CountVectorizer

📄 Simple, explainable approach without black-box deep learning

⚙️ How It Works
Merge metadata (movies.csv) and credits (credits.csv) datasets

Extract relevant features: genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview

Combine all features into a single "tags" column

Convert text to numeric vectors using CountVectorizer

Calculate cosine similarity between movies

Recommend top 5 similar movies for any selected movie

📊 Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

ast

nltk (for optional text preprocessing)

💻 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/jyothir-369/Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML
2️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
3️⃣ Open movie-recommendation-system.ipynb and run all cells.

🔧 Improvements (To-Do)
✅ Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit

🌟 Use TF-IDF or Word2Vec for better text representation

🎞️ Add movie posters in output

🧠 Experiment with hybrid recommendations (collaborative + content-based)

🌐 Integration with TMDB or IMDB APIs
