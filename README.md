🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML
A simple yet powerful content-based movie recommender system built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. This system recommends movies based on user input by analyzing movie metadata — such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and plot overviews.

Ideal for beginners exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) and recommendation systems.

🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning and NLP techniques can be applied to build a practical and interpretable recommendation engine. It uses content-based filtering, comparing textual metadata across movies to generate personalized suggestions.

🎯 Key Features
✅ Content-based filtering using movie metadata

🎭 Uses genres, cast, crew, keywords, and plot summaries

⚡ Fast and lightweight — based on cosine similarity

🧠 Fully interpretable logic (no black-box deep learning)

🔢 Simple vectorization via Scikit-learn’s CountVectorizer

⚙️ How It Works
📂 Load movies.csv and credits.csv using Pandas

🔗 Merge both datasets on the movie ID

🧾 Extract metadata: genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview

🏷️ Combine all into a single tags column

🔢 Vectorize the tags using CountVectorizer

📐 Compute cosine similarity among movie vectors

🎯 Recommend Top 5 similar movies based on selected input

📦 Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

ast

nltk (optional: for advanced preprocessing)

💻 Getting Started
🔨 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Run the Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/jyothir-369/Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML
jupyter notebook
Then open movie-recommendation-system.ipynb and run the cells to explore movie recommendations.

🔧 Potential Improvements
🌐 Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

🧠 Upgrade vectorization with TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT

🎞️ Add movie posters via TMDB API

🤝 Implement hybrid filtering (content + collaborative)

📡 Integrate with external APIs (TMDB, IMDb)
