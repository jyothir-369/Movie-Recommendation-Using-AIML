A practical **content-based movie recommender** built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. This system suggests movies similar to a given input based on genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview — perfect for learners exploring **NLP** and **recommendation engines**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how **machine learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** can be applied to build a real-world movie recommendation engine. It uses rich movie metadata and applies **content-based filtering** to generate relevant suggestions.

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Content-Based Filtering using movie metadata
- 🎭 Based on genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview
- 🧠 Transparent, explainable model (no black-box deep learning)
- ⚡ Fast and interpretable using **cosine similarity**
- 🧮 Text vectorization via **CountVectorizer**

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Merge `movies.csv` and `credits.csv` using movie ID.
2. Extract key columns: genres, keywords, cast, crew, overview.
3. Combine features into a unified `tags` column.
4. Convert tags into numerical vectors using `CountVectorizer`.
5. Compute cosine similarity between movie vectors.
6. Recommend top 5 similar movies based on input.

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `ast`
- `nltk` *(optional for advanced preprocessing)*

## 💻 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jyothir-369/Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML
2️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook
bash
jupyter notebook
3️⃣ Run the Notebook
Open movie-recommendation-system.ipynb and run all cells to see the recommendation system in action.

🔧 Potential Improvements
🌐 Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

🧠 Use TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT for richer text embeddings

🎞️ Display movie posters in recommendation output

🔁 Add hybrid filtering (Content + Collaborative)

📡 Integrate with TMDB or IMDb API for real-time data
