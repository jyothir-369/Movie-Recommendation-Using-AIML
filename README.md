# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML

A simple yet powerful **content-based movie recommender system** built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. It suggests similar movies based on user input, using metadata such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and plot overviews.

> Ideal for beginners exploring **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **recommendation systems**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning and NLP can be applied to build a practical and interpretable **recommendation engine**. We use **content-based filtering** to generate movie suggestions by comparing metadata similarity.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Content-Based Filtering using metadata
- 🎭 Leverages genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview
- 🧠 Fully explainable (no deep learning)
- ⚡ Fast similarity computation with **cosine similarity**
- 🧮 Vectorization with `CountVectorizer` from Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 📂 Load `movies.csv` and `credits.csv` using Pandas
2. 🔗 Merge both datasets on movie ID
3. 🧾 Extract metadata: genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview
4. 🏷️ Combine all into a single `tags` column
5. 🔢 Vectorize text using **CountVectorizer**
6. 📐 Compute **cosine similarity** between movie vectors
7. 🎯 Recommend **Top 5 similar movies** based on selected input

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `ast`
- `nltk` *(optional for advanced NLP preprocessing)*

## 💻 Getting Started

### 🔨 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.7+)
- Jupyter Notebook

### 🚀 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jyothir-369/Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML
▶️ Launch the Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Then open movie-recommendation-system.ipynb and run the cells to explore the recommendations.

🔧 Potential Improvements
🌐 Deploy as a Flask or Streamlit web application

🧠 Upgrade vectorization using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT

🎞️ Display movie posters using TMDB API

🔁 Implement hybrid filtering (content + collaborative)

📡 Integrate external APIs like TMDB or IMDb
