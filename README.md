🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML
A content-based movie recommender built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. This system suggests movies similar to a selected one based on genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview — ideal for learners exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) and recommendation engines.

🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning and NLP techniques can be applied to build a real-world movie recommendation engine. It leverages rich metadata and uses content-based filtering to generate relevant and meaningful movie suggestions.

🎯 Features
✅ Content-Based Filtering using movie metadata

🎭 Based on genres, cast, crew, keywords, and movie overview

🧠 Transparent model — no black-box deep learning

⚡ Fast and explainable with cosine similarity

🧮 Vectorization via CountVectorizer

⚙️ How It Works
Merge movies.csv and credits.csv using the movie ID.

Extract key features: genres, keywords, cast, crew, overview.

Combine these features into a single tags column.

Vectorize the tags using CountVectorizer.

Calculate cosine similarity between vectors.

Recommend top 5 similar movies based on input.

🔧 Potential Improvements
🌐 Deploy as a Flask or Streamlit web app

🧠 Use TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT for richer text embeddings

🎞️ Display movie posters alongside recommendations

🔁 Add hybrid filtering (content + collaborative)

📡 Integrate with TMDB or IMDb APIs for live data
