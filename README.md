🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML
A simple yet effective content-based movie recommender built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. It suggests movies similar to your input based on genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overviews.

🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates how machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) can be used to build a movie recommendation engine. It's ideal for learners of AI/ML looking for a hands-on application with real-world datasets.

🎯 Features
🔍 Content-Based Filtering using movie metadata

🎭 Recommends movies based on:

Genres

Overview

Cast & Crew

Keywords

🧠 Uses Cosine Similarity for calculating closeness between movies

📊 Preprocessing and vectorization with CountVectorizer

⚙️ Transparent & explainable model (no deep learning black-boxes)

⚙️ How It Works
Merge movies.csv and credits.csv on movie ID

Extract relevant columns: genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview

Combine all features into a single tags column

Convert tags to numeric vectors using CountVectorizer

Compute similarity using cosine similarity

Recommend top 5 most similar movies

📦 Libraries Used
pandas

🔧 Improvements (To-Do)
✅ Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

🌟 Use TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT for richer embeddings

🎞️ Add movie posters to the recommendation output

🧠 Add hybrid recommendation (content + collaborative filtering)

🌐 Integrate with TMDB or IMDb API for real-time data
