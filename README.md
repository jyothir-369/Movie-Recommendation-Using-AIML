# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML

A simple yet powerful **content-based movie recommender** built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. This system suggests similar movies based on a selected title, utilizing metadata like genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overviews.

> Ideal for beginners exploring **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **recommendation systems**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how AI/ML techniques can be used to build a practical recommendation engine. By leveraging content-based filtering, we generate transparent and explainable movie suggestions using metadata and vector similarity.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **Content-Based Filtering** using movie metadata  
- 🎭 Uses **genres, cast, crew, keywords, overview**
- 🧠 No deep learning involved — **fully explainable**
- ⚡ Fast recommendations using **cosine similarity**
- 🧮 Vectorization via `CountVectorizer`

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 📂 Load `movies.csv` and `credits.csv` using Pandas  
2. 🔗 Merge both datasets using the movie ID  
3. 🧾 Extract features: `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, `crew`, `overview`  
4. 🏷️ Combine into a new `tags` column  
5. 🔢 Apply `CountVectorizer` for vectorization  
6. 📐 Calculate **cosine similarity** between vectors  
7. 🎯 Recommend top 5 most similar movies

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `ast`
- `nltk` *(optional — for enhanced NLP preprocessing)*
