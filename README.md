🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML
A practical content-based movie recommender built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. It suggests movies similar to a given input based on genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview — ideal for AI/ML learners exploring NLP and recommendation engines.

🚀 Overview
This project shows how machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) can be used to create a real-world movie recommendation engine. It uses movie metadata to generate relevant suggestions through content-based filtering techniques.

🎓 Great for beginners and intermediate learners looking for a hands-on AI/ML application!

🎯 Features
✅ Content-Based Filtering using rich movie metadata
✅ Recommends movies based on:

🎭 Genres

📝 Overview

🎬 Cast & Crew

🗝️ Keywords

✅ Transparent, explainable model (no black-box deep learning)
✅ Fast and interpretable with cosine similarity
✅ Uses CountVectorizer for text vectorization

⚙️ How It Works
Merge movies.csv and credits.csv using movie ID.

Extract important columns: genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview.

Combine these features into a unified tags column.

Convert tags into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.

Compute cosine similarity between movie vectors.

Recommend top 5 similar movies based on input.

🔧 Potential Improvements
🌐 Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

🧠 Use TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT for richer text embeddings

🎞️ Display movie posters in recommendation output

🔁 Add hybrid filtering (Content + Collaborative)

📡 Integrate with TMDB or IMDb API for real-time data
