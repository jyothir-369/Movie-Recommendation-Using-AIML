🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML
A simple yet powerful content-based movie recommender system built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The system suggests movies based on user input by analyzing movie metadata—such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and plot overviews.

📘 Ideal for beginners exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Recommender Systems.

🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning and NLP techniques can be applied to build a practical and interpretable content-based filtering recommendation engine.

It compares textual metadata across movies to generate personalized suggestions without relying on deep learning or external user data.

🎯 Key Features
✅ Content-based filtering using movie metadata

🎭 Utilizes genres, cast, crew, keywords, and plot summaries

⚡ Fast & lightweight, based on cosine similarity

🧠 Fully interpretable logic (no black-box models)

🔢 Vectorization with Scikit-learn’s CountVectorizer

⚙️ How It Works
📂 Load movies.csv and credits.csv using Pandas

🔗 Merge datasets on the movie ID

🧾 Extract metadata: genres, keywords, cast, crew, overview

🏷️ Combine them into a single tags column

🔢 Convert tags into vectors using CountVectorizer

📐 Compute cosine similarity between movie vectors

🎯 Recommend Top 5 similar movies to the selected input

📦 Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

ast

nltk (optional for advanced NLP preprocessing)

💻 Getting Started
🔨 Prerequisites
Make sure the following are installed:

Python 3.7+

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Run the Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/jyothir-369/Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-Using-AIML
jupyter notebook
Open movie-recommendation-system.ipynb and run the cells to get movie recommendations based on your input.

🔧 Potential Improvements
🌐 Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

🧠 Use advanced embeddings: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT

🎞️ Fetch movie posters using TMDB API

🤝 Implement hybrid filtering (content + collaborative)

📡 Integrate external APIs like IMDb or TMDB
