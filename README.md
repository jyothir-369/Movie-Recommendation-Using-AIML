🎬 Movie Recommendation System using AI/ML
A simple yet effective content-based movie recommender built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. It suggests movies similar to a given input based on genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview.

🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates how machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) can be used to build a practical movie recommendation engine.

It’s an ideal project for AI/ML learners looking for a hands-on application using real-world datasets.

🎯 Features
🔍 Content-Based Filtering using movie metadata

🎭 Recommends movies based on:

Genres

Overview

Cast & Crew

Keywords

🧠 Uses Cosine Similarity to compute movie similarity

📊 CountVectorizer for preprocessing and vectorization

⚙️ Transparent and explainable model — no deep learning black boxes

⚙️ How It Works
Merge movies.csv and credits.csv using the movie ID.

Extract key columns: genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview.

Combine features into a single tags column.

Convert tags into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.

Calculate cosine similarity between vectors.

Recommend the top 5 similar movies to the input movie.

🔧 Potential Improvements
✅ Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

🌟 Use TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT for richer embeddings

🎞️ Add movie posters to recommendation outputs

🧠 Add hybrid filtering (Content + Collaborative)

🌐 Integrate with TMDB or IMDb API for real-time metadata
